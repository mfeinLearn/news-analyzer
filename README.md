### **Scenario**

Imagine you're a junior tech professional working at a tech startup that specializes in Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions. Your team is working on a project to analyze the content of news articles to extract valuable insights. As part of this project, you've been tasked with developing a Python program that can perform various text analysis tasks on a given news article. These tasks include counting the number of times a specific word is used, identifying the most common word, calculating the average length of words, counting the number of paragraphs, and counting the number of sentences in the text.

### **1. Define the Problem**

Develop a Python script/program that can perform various text analysis tasks on a given news article.

### **2. Determine the Design**

- **Read Text:** Read the contents of the provided news article text file into a Python string variable.
- **Count Specific Word:** \* Implement a function that counts the number of occurrences of the specified (TBD) word in the text.
- Display the count of the specified word.

- **Identify Most Common Word:**
- Implement a function that identifies the most common word in the text.
- Display the most common word.

- **Calculate Average Word Length:**
- Implement a function that calculates the average length of words in the text.
- Exclude punctuation marks and special characters from the word length calculation.
- Display the average word length.

- **Count Number of Paragraphs:**
- Implement a function that counts the number of paragraphs in the text.
- Define paragraphs based on empty lines between blocks of text.
- Display the count of paragraphs.

- **Count Number of Sentences:**
- Implement a function that counts the number of sentences in the text.
- Define sentences based on punctuation marks such as periods, exclamation marks, and question marks.
- Display the count of sentences.

### **3. Develop Code**

Develop your code and script named, `pythonAssessment.py`, to match the design. Your script should adhere to the following:

| Criteria                    | Requirement                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text Analysis**           | Correct implementation of each text analysis task         |
| **Efficiency**              | Efficiency and readability of the code                    |
| **Functions and Variables** | Proper use of functions and appropriate variable names    |
| **Accuracy**                | Accuracy in counting words, paragraphs, and sentences     |
| **Coding Best Practices**   | Adherence to Python coding conventions and best practices |
| **Clarity**                 | Clarity and completeness of user prompts and output       |

---

### **4. Test and Refine**

- Run your program with different number of occurrences and parameters.
- Verify that the appropriate code blocks are executed based on the conditions.
- Make any necessary adjustments to the code blocks to achieve the desired outcome.
